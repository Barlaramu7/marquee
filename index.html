        <p>The Automated Road Damage Detection system leverages UAV-captured images and deep learning techniques to identify and categorize road damages efficiently. By utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model processes high-resolution aerial images to detect various types of road damage, such as cracks, potholes, and surface wear. This approach offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for road maintenance and monitoring. Additionally, the system's integration with a user-friendly frontend interface ensures easy visualization and interpretation of detection results, facilitating prompt maintenance actions.</p>
